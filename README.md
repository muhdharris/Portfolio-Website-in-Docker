# Portfolio Website in Docker

This project is a **Portfolio Website** hosted in **Docker** containers, created as part of a learning exercise for a web development course. It showcases a fully responsive frontend and a basic backend API, all running in containerized environments.

## Overview

This project demonstrates:
- A **responsive portfolio website** created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A **backend API** built with Node.js to serve dynamic content.
- The use of **Docker** to containerize the frontend and backend.
- **NGINX** as a web server for hosting static frontend files.
- **Docker Compose** to orchestrate the entire application stack.

It serves as an example of combining **web development** and **containerization tools** for educational purposes.
